Therefore, investing in safer streets means investing in these comunities engaging with them about their safety needs and experiences.\n\n##### Our Guding Principles\n\n1. People will make mistakes on the road.\n2. The consequences of these mistakes should not be death or serioius injury.\n3. Reducing vehicle speed is fundamental to safer streets.\n",

Our focus will be protecting our most vulnerable road users, including children, older adults, and people walking and bicycling.\n\nWe’ve already begun the work. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation has identified a network of streets, the High Injury Network (HIN), where strategic investments will have the biggest impact in reducing deaths and severe injuries. Despite making up only six percent of our city streets, nearly two-thirds of all deaths and severe injuries involving people walking occur on the HIN. This is where we will focus our initial Vision Zero actions.\n\nVision Zero initiatives have a proven track record in major cities and countries throughout the world.

That is what Vision Zero is all about.\n\nEvery year, more than 200 people are killed while trying to move throughtout our city. Nearly half the people killed on our streets are those who were walking or bicycling, and an alarming number of them are children and older adults. In fact, traffic collisions are a leading cause of death for children in Los Angeles.\n\nVision Zero Los Angeles is our city's commitment to eliminate all traffic deaths by 2025.

As directed by Mayor Garcetti, this citywide effort brings together transportation engineers, police officers, advocates, and policymakers to work together towards creating safer streets. Our focus will be protecting our most vulnerable road users, including children, older adults, and people walking and bicycling.\n\nWe’ve already begun the work. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation has identified a network of streets, the High Injury Network (HIN), where strategic investments will have the biggest impact in reducing deaths and severe injuries. Despite making up only six percent of our city streets, nearly two-thirds of all deaths and severe injuries involving people walking occur on the HIN. This is where we will focus our initial Vision Zero actions.\n\nVision Zero initiatives have a proven track record in major cities and countries throughout the world. It is time for our Los Angeles vision: zero traffic deaths on our streets by the year 2025.",

      "Long Description": "Every year, more than 200 people are killed while trying to move throughout our city. Nearly half the people killed on our streets are those who were walking or bicycling, and an alarming number of them are children and older adults. In fact, traffic collisions are a leading cause of death for children in Los Angeles.\n\n<iframe width=\"740\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qeHCnc166P4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\n\nVision Zero Los Angeles is our city’s commitment to eliminate all traffic deaths by 2025. As directed by Mayor Garcetti, this citywide effort brings together transportation engineers, police officers, advocates, and policymakers to work together towards creating safer streets. Our focus will be protecting our most vulnerable road users, including children, older adults, and people walking and bicycling.\n\nWe’ve already begun the work. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation has identified a network of streets, the High Injury Network (HIN), where strategic investments will have the biggest impact in reducing deaths and severe injuries. Despite making up only six percent of our city streets, nearly two-thirds of all deaths and severe injuries involving people walking occur on the HIN. This is where we will focus our initial Vision Zero actions.\n\nVision Zero initiatives have a proven track record in major cities and countries throughout the world. It is time for our Los Angeles vision: zero traffic deaths on our streets by the year 2025.",

      "Short Description": "Vision Zero is working in partnership with the City of Los Angeles to end all traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2025.",
      "Long Description": "Every year, more than 200 people are killed while trying to move throughout our city. Nearly half the people killed on our streets are those who were walking or bicycling, and an alarming number of them are children and older adults. In fact, traffic collisions are a leading cause of death for children in Los Angeles.\n\n<iframe width=\"740\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qeHCnc166P4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<br>\n\nVision Zero Los Angeles is our city’s commitment to eliminate all traffic deaths by 2025. As directed by Mayor Garcetti, this citywide effort brings together transportation engineers, police officers, advocates, and policymakers to work together towards creating safer streets. Our focus will be protecting our most vulnerable road users, including children, older adults, and people walking and bicycling.\n\nWe’ve already begun the work. The Los Angeles Department of Transportation has identified a network of streets, the High Injury Network (HIN), where strategic investments will have the biggest impact in reducing deaths and severe injuries. Despite making up only six percent of our city streets, nearly two-thirds of all deaths and severe injuries involving people walking occur on the HIN. This is where we will focus our initial Vision Zero actions.\n\nVision Zero initiatives have a proven track record in major cities and countries throughout the world. It is time for our Los Angeles vision: zero traffic deaths on our streets by the year 2025.",
